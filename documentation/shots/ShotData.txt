Each row consists of a single shot event. 

Positions are quoted in meters, with the origin located at the centre of the goal. The x-coordinate measures perpendicular distance from the goal line while the y-coordinate measures perpendicular distance from the line that joins the centre spot and the centre of the goal. For example, a penalty is at co-ordinates (10.97, 0) meters.
